      WASD to move - W and S move character forwards and backwards, A and D rotate character.<br>
      Your only weapon is a spiked shield. Fortunately, it works quite well. Running into zombies will kill them most of the time. If it doesn't work the first time, try retreating for a bit.<br>
      The score is a little misleading - you get 100 points per killed zombie. Every 10 kills you level up, restoring some health and stamina and gaining extra maximum health and stamina.<br>
      Make sure to keep an eye on the top-left of your UI to check on your health and stamina, although there is an obvious visual indicator when you get below 50% health and 50% stamina.<br>
      You can restore a lot of health and stamina through using the potions that occasionally drop from zombies. On average, the percentage drop chance is 5%.<br> 
      You can use stamina to jump, sprint, or regenerate health. Depending on the action taken, a different amount of stamina is used up - stamina uses up the most, followed by regeneration, followed by jumping.<br>
      In order to win the game, you will either have to kill 100 zombies or wait out the day-long storm. Both winning conditions are tracked in the top-right corner of your UI - make sure to check them out!<br>
      It's a lot easier to win the game by defending the chickens during the time limit, but it is very much possible to beat the game eariler by killing all the zombies. Try challenging yourself to see how fast you can do it!<br>
      Do note that every time you level up, the zombies grow stronger as well.
      <p>Good luck!</p>
