      <h2>Controls and Tips</h2>
      WASD to move - W and S move character forwards and backwards, A and D rotate character.<br>
      Your only weapon is a spiked shield. Fortunately, it works quite well. Running into zombies will kill them most of the time. If it doesn't work the first time, try retreating for a bit.<br>
      The score is a little misleading - you get 100 points per killed zombie. Every 10 kills you level up, restoring some health and stamina and gaining extra maximum health and stamina.<br>
      Make sure to keep an eye on the top-left of your UI to check on your health and stamina, although there is an obvious visual indicator when you get below 50% health and 50% stamina.<br>
      You can restore a lot of health and stamina through using the potions that occasionally drop from zombies. On average, the percentage drop chance is 5%.<br> 
      You can use stamina to jump, sprint, or regenerate health. Depending on the action taken, a different amount of stamina is used up - stamina uses up the most, followed by regeneration, followed by jumping.<br>
      In order to win the game, you will either have to kill 100 zombies or wait out the day-long storm. Both winning conditions are tracked in the top-right corner of your UI - make sure to check them out!<br>
      Do note that every time you level up, the zombies grow stronger as well.
      <p>Good luck!</p>
